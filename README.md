Chat.Io
========================================================================


Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chat.Io Chat Server allows users to communicate with other users in real time using Instant Messaging.

Installing
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (Requires Node.js 9)


Detailed installation instructions
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chat.Io requires [Node.js][6] installed,  8.10 or later (7.7 or later can work, but you might as well be on the latest stable).
Chat.Io is installed and run using a command line. In Mac OS X, open `Terminal` (it's in Utilities). In Windows, open `Command Prompt` (type `cmd` into the Start menu and it should be the first result). Type this into the command line:

cd LOCATION 
Replace `LOCATION` with the location Chat.io is in (ending up with, for instance, `cd "~/Downloads/Chat.io"` or `cd "C:\Users\Bob\Downloads\Chat.io\"`).

This will set your command line's location to Chat.Io's folder. You'll have to do this each time you open a command line to run commands for Chat.Io.

Now, to Install Chat.Io, run the command:

    npm install

Now, to Start Chat.Io, run the Command:
 
    node server
    
(If you're not on Windows, we recommend doing `./Chat.Io` instead.)

You can also specify a port:

    node Chat.Io 3000

Visit your server at `http://SERVER:3000`
